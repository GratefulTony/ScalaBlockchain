Blockchain Voting Package
=========================

This package represents a very early attempt at using the blockchain to faciltate secure, transparent delegation voting.

This is but one of many possible implementations of this type of system.

In particular, a blockchain vote consists of delegation transactions and output transactions which are "marked" by including predeclared addresses in the outputs.
